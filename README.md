# Pattern-Recognisation-Labs

“A pattern is the opposite of chaos; it is an  entity vaguely defined, that could be given a  name.” 
or
"A pattern is an abstract object, such as a set  of measurements describing a physical  object."

Pattern Recognition Applications ;
• Vision  
  –Face/Handwriting/Hand  
• Speech  
  –Speaker/Speech  
• TEXTUAL DATA  
  •Text Categorization 
  •Information Retrieval  
  •Data Mining
  •Information Retrieval  
  •Data Mining  

Machine Perception :
  • Build a machine that can recognize patterns:
    • Speech recognition 
    • Fingerprint identification 
    • OCR (Optical Character Recognition) 
    • DNA sequence identification 

Pattern Recognition Systems :
• Sensing 
  • Use of a transducer (camera or microphone) 
  • PR system depends of the bandwidth, the resolution  sensitivity distortion of the transducer 
• Segmentation and grouping 
  • Patterns should be well separated and should not overlap
• Feature extraction 
  • Discriminative features 
  •Invariant features with respect to translation, rotation and  scale. 
• Classification 
  • Use a feature vector provided by a feature extractor to  assign the object to a category 
• Post Processing 
  • Exploit context input dependent information other than from

The Design Cycle :
  • Data Collection 
    • How do we know when we have collected an adequately  large and representative set of examples for training and  testing the system?
  • Feature Choice 
    • Depends on the characteristics of the problem domain.  Simple to extract, invariant to irrelevant transformation  insensitive to noise.
  • Model Choice 
    • Unsatisfied with the performance of our fish classifier and  want to jump to another class of model
  • Training 
    • Use data to determine the classifier. Many different  procedures for training classifiers and choosing models
  • Evaluation 
    • Measure the error rate (or performance and switch from  one set of features to another one
  • Computational Complexity 
    • What is the trade-off between computational ease and  performance? 
    • (How an algorithm scales as a function of the number of  features, patterns or categories?)


Learning and Adaptation :
  • Supervised learning 
    • A teacher provides a category label or cost for each  pattern in the training set 
  • Unsupervised learning 
    • The system forms clusters or “natural groupings” of the  input patterns

Conclusion :
  • Reader seems to be overwhelmed by the number,  complexity and magnitude of the sub-problems of  Pattern Recognition 
  • Many of these sub-problems can indeed be solved 
  • Many fascinating unsolved problems still remain
